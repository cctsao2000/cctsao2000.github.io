                <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
                <p>SmartSkate is a wearable device designed for rollerblading/rollerskating beginners, aiming to enhance their
                    practice sessions. SmartSkate provides real-time alerts to users, notifying them if they exceed safe speeds
                    or are approaching obstacles while skating. These alerts offer beginner skaters more time to react and avoid
                    potential dangers.</p>
                <p>By connecting a smartphone with the device via Bluetooth, SmartSkate captures data such as practice dates,
                    times, average skating speeds, total distances covered, and overall skating durations into a text file,
                    which allows skaters to review their progress over time.</p>
                <p>Developed as a prototype utilizing Circuit Python and Circuit Playground, this project represents an initial
                    iteration of SmartSkate, with the potential for further enhancements and refinements in the future.</p>

                <h3 id="design-and-planning">Design and Planning</h3>
                <p>
                    SmartSkate incorporates three main features: an <b>overspeed alert system</b>, an <b>obstacle detector</b>, and a <b>skating
                        record generator</b>.</p>
                <p>For novice skaters, mastering speed control is an initial challenge. Going downhills without proper braking
                    techniques can pose significant risks. The overspeed alert utilizes the accelerometer data from the Circuit
                    Playground. If the acceleration within a designated timeframe (i.e., 0.1 sec) exceeds the set limit, the
                    NeoPixels will turn red for 3 seconds and the speaker will play the audio “You are going overspeed, try
                    slowing down.” Beginner skaters receiving this notice could try braking, go onto grass, or adjust their body
                    position to properly fall.</p>
                <p>The obstacle detector employs the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor to measure the distance between the
                    skate and any obstacle. The sensor is placed on the skate so that it can detect obstacles with lower height
                    while the skater remains attentive to road conditions. Upon detecting obstacle within a certain distance (by
                    default 3m), the NeoPixels will turn blue for 3 seconds and the speaker will play the audio “Be careful!
                    There’s an obstacle in 3 meters.”</p>
                <p>By stablishing a Bluetooth connection between SmartSkate and a smartphone, SmartSkate could document
                    essential metrics such as practice dates and times, average skating speeds, total distances covered, and
                    skating durations. With the data logged into a text file, skaters could easily review their progress over
                    time. This function requires the board’s writing access which is controlled in the boot.py file [1]. Since
                    the device is tied on the skate, the connected smartphone takes the role of a controller. Location data
                    collected in Bluefruit Connect is required for SmartSkate to track the skating distances. The 6 decimal
                    points latitude and longitude data allow SmartSkate to calculate the moving distance with an accuracy of 10
                    centimeters. The 1 and 2 button on the control pad represents start recording and end recording
                    respectively. The yellow light of NeoPixels indicates the start of a recording while purple signals ending a
                    recording.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The circuit diagram of SmartSkate is presented above. There’s an issue with the audio system due to the low-volume
                    speaker on Circuit Playground. While connecting it to headphones could address this concern, it introduces a safety
                    risk, as the wire may potentially cause skaters to trip. The HC-SR sensor has a 5V echo output that cannot
                    be directly connected to the inputs of Circuit Playground [2]. Therefore, I connected it with two 10k
                    resistors as a potential divider. Additionally, a 3 AA battery holder is utilized instead of the provided
                    lithium battery since it does not support the HC-SR sensor.

        <p>The above images presents the system on and off a breadboard. A case is designed to prevent the system to
            break easily if dropped. Selecting a clear material to print the case will ensure better functionality.

        <h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
        <p>As a prototype, there are certain weaknesses and limitations in the product that could be enhanced in future
            versions. Implementing a wireless audio system would not only ensure better sound quality but also eliminate
            the risk of users tripping over cables. Enhancements to the case design, perhaps utilizing materials like
            Acrylic, would offer clearer visibility for the device&#39;s lights while providing robust protection for
            the hardware. Introducing a user interface that incorporates user input would enable customization of speed
            limits and object detection sensitivity. Moreover, incorporating a dynamic obstacle detection system could
            better accommodate skaters of varying speeds, as their required reaction times may differ.</p>
