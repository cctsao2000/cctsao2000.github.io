        "intro": "Pinball is a classic and traditional game in many night markets across Taiwan. It is a tabletop game where players launch small marbles onto a tilted board, aiming to land them in numbered or colored holes. Traditionally, players use a Mahjong ruler to shoot the marble, trying to land the marbles either very focused or very scattered to win the best prize. In this project, we fabricated a pinball game board mainly by laser cutting featuring an embedded CLUE board and LEDs to enhance interactivity and engagement.",

        "intro": "Inspired by the delicate woodwork of a Yosegi puzzle box, I decided to work on a laser-cut version of the puzzle box. Yosegi-Zaiku（寄木細工）is a Japanese woodwork technique that utilizes the different colors of various types of wood to create geometric patterns on the wood surface. Traditional Yosegi Puzzle Boxes are mostly rectangular boxes, usually taking 4-27 steps to solve them. In my laser-cut version, I kept the repetitive geometric pattern and the puzzle elements to retain the Yosegi-like features and build a round shape box with self-designed mechanisms to ensure its uniqueness and originality. To match the theme of the rounded shape box, I utilized the spinning (rotating) feature and embedded a roller-bearing into the design. The mechanism features a box with an interlocking structure, and two additional layers of puzzle -- the nail stopper and the spinning magnet key, building on top of that.",
